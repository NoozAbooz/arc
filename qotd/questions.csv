Solve for t: 20 = (1/2)*10*t² -> 20 = 5t² -> t² = 4 -> t = 2 seconds.,Physics,Easy
95,A ball is dropped from a height of 20 m. What is its velocity the moment before it hits the ground? (Assume g = 10 m/s²),"20 m/s,10 m/s,40 m/s,200 m/s",0,"Use the kinematic equation: v_f² = v_i² + 2ad. The initial velocity (v_i) is 0 m/s (dropped), acceleration (a) is g = 10 m/s², and distance (d) is 20 m. v_f² = 0 + 2*10*20 = 400. Therefore, v_f = √400 = 20 m/s.",Physics,Easy
96,A ball is thrown straight up with an initial velocity of 30 m/s. How high does it go? (Assume g = 10 m/s²),"45 m,90 m,60 m,15 m",0,"At its maximum height, the ball's velocity is 0 m/s. Use v_f² = v_i² + 2ad. v_f = 0, v_i = 30 m/s, a = -g = -10 m/s² (negative because it opposes the motion). Solve for d: 0 = (30)² + 2*(-10)*d -> 0 = 900 - 20d -> 20d = 900 -> d = 45 meters.",Physics,Easy
97,A ball is thrown straight up with an initial velocity of 30 m/s. How long is it in the air? (Assume g = 10 m/s²),"3 s,6 s,9 s,12 s",1,The time to go up equals the time to come down. Find the time to reach the top (where v_f = 0) using v_f = v_i + at. 0 = 30 + (-10)t -> 10t = 30 -> t = 3 seconds to go up. Total time in air is twice this: 2 * 3 s = 6 seconds.,Physics,Easy
100,A book is sitting on a table. What forces are acting on the book?,"Gravity and the normal force,Gravity only,The normal force only,Gravity and friction",0,"Two forces act on the book: gravity pulls it downward, and the table exerts an upward force called the normal force. Since the book is not accelerating, these two forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. There is no friction because the book is not attempting to slide.",Physics,Easy
